# Update 3/26/2021: I am going to shut down this extension and deactive the backend in the near future. 

I also have lost permissions to update the extension on the marketplace unfortunately, so I'm not able to accept any PRs or deploy changes. 

## Update 3/18/2020: As stated below, I do not work on the Azure Boards team anymore, and as of now I don't have time to maintain this extension.

## Contributing

**Update 9/18/19**: I don't work on the `Azure Boards` team anymore so I'll have less time to work on this extension. If you want to send a PR I'll gladly review and merge it.

### Developing and Testing

<span style="color: green">To test your work, first [follow these steps to set up a DevOps marketplace publisher account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/publish/overview?view=azure-devops) (if you already have an account move on).

1. Run `npm run package-dev` and upload the package as a private extension to your  Azure DevOps publisher account
> Note: You may need to add a directory called `build` to the project root when running the script. The output of the `package-dev` script is there.
 - Be sure to update the `manifest.json` to use your publisher's ID before running the script.
2. Install the private extension on your Azure DevOps oragnization and test your changes.
